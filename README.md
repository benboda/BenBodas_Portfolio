## [Project 1: Econometric Analysis of What Metrics Are Most Significant in Predicting the Number of Wins a Team Will Achieve in the MLB](https://github.com/benboda/Econometrics_Term_Paper.git)

This was a project I did for my Econometrics class during my undergraduate studies. I examined a question that I found interesting which was: What metrics matter most for MLB teams? Throughout the course of the research there some notable findings and I ended up taking a dataset with 80 features and finished with a model that only contained 2. I got to practice my EDA skills as well as feature engineering, dimensionality reduction and examining model testing results to determine the true underlying value in each feature that was used. I looked at things like p values, t statistics and z scores while also ensuring the model didn't violate Gauss-Markov key assumptions of linear regression.

## [Project 2: Analyzing Real Estate Prices from Indian Cities](https://github.com/benboda/Real_Estate_Price_Prediction_Project.git)

This a project I did to further my comfort level with EDA as well as running a linear regression machine learning model and comparing it to other possible models for their accuracy.
